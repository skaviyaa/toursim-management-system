		<center>
		<p> Kodaikanal is a hill town in the southern Indian state of Tamil Nadu.
		It’s set in an area of granite cliffs, forested valleys, lakes, waterfalls and grassy hills. 
		At 2,000 meters above sea level, the town centers around man-made, star-shaped Kodaikanal Lake, bordered by evergreen forest.
		The pride of Kodaikanal is the ‘Kurinji-flower’, which blossoms once in 12 years, imparting an ethereal beauty to the hills. 
		The hill town is also renowned for its educational institutions of internatonal repute.
       Best time to visit Kodaikanal is April to June during the summer. Monsoon from September to October also offers different experience.<p>
